# Using tweepy
Tweepy supports accessing Twitter via Basic Authentication and the newer method, OAuth. Twitter has stopped accepting Basic 
Authentication so OAuth is now the only way to use the Twitter API.

Tweepy provides access to the well documented Twitter API. With tweepy, it's possible to get any object and use any method
that the official Twitter API offers. For example, a User object has its documentation at 
https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/users and following those guidelines, tweepy can get the appropriate information.
