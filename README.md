# Sample-twitter-bot
 A sample Twitter bot in Python - created by @jayant24. This is part of my personal python netwoking project.

If you don't have Python 3 installed (if the above command fails):
 Either install Python 3 on your computer OR use something like Heroku, Digital Ocean or any other online platfrm.
 
# Files
1.) my_twitter_bot.py - This is the main file that includes all the logic.

2.) last_seen_id.txt - This will contain the ID of the tweet that my_twitter_bot.py has seen last. If you see any errors when running the main file, try replacing the content with the ID of one of the tweets you want to examine.
